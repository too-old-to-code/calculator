## Functional-calculator

After reading 'Functional-Light JavaScript' by Kyle Simpson, I wanted to test some of the functional style programming techniques.
I decided to do this by creating a calculator.

Not wanting to forget some of the things I learnt, I decided to create a walk through of the code. You can find it here: [Calculator code walkthrough](https://too-old-to-code.github.io/calculator/)

This is a WIP. I haven't decided how I want this to work on mobile devices yet, and I haven't fully described every potential route through the logic.
